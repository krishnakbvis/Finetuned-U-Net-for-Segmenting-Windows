Student project for Computer Vision (COMP4528) at ANU, involving deep learning from a single image of John Curtin School of Medical Research.
For this project, I used an existing webapp based on Meta's SAM (Segment Anything Model) tool to hand-label masks generated by Stable Diffusion, with the original image as input. I investigated various loss functions and the effect of different hyperparameters empirically using Tensorboard before training a final model based on a combination of Focal and Tversky losses.
